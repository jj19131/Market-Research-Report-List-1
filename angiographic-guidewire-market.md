<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Angiographic Guidewire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PTFE Coated</li><li>Uncoated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Angiographic guidewires are used in minimally invasive procedures to navigate through blood vessels. There are two main types in the market: PTFE coated and uncoated guidewires. PTFE coated guidewires have a layer of polytetrafluoroethylene which provides smooth navigation through vessels and reduces friction. Uncoated guidewires are typically made of stainless steel or nitinol and are used in procedures where PTFE coating is not necessary. Both types have their own advantages and are chosen based on the specific requirements of the procedure.</p></p>
