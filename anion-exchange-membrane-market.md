<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anion Exchange Membrane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Strong Base</li><li>Weak Base</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Anion exchange membranes are divided into two main types based on the strength of the base functional groups they contain: Strong Base and Weak Base. Strong Base membranes are highly efficient at anion exchange due to their positively charged sites that can easily attract and exchange anions. Weak Base membranes, on the other hand, have lower exchange capacities but offer improved selectivity for specific anions. Both types play a crucial role in various industries, such as energy storage, water treatment, and pharmaceuticals.</p></p>
