<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Truck EGR System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External EGR</li><li>Internal EGR</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Truck EGR System market consists of two main types: External EGR and Internal EGR. External EGR systems recirculate exhaust gases back into the intake system before combustion, reducing nitrogen oxide emissions. Internal EGR systems, on the other hand, recirculate gases within the combustion chamber itself. Both types play a crucial role in reducing harmful emissions and improving fuel efficiency in trucks. The choice between External and Internal EGR systems depends on the specific design and requirements of the vehicle.</p></p>
