<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Natural Graphite Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Crystalline Graphite</li><li>Implicit Crystalline Graphite</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Natural graphite can be classified into two main market types: Crystalline Graphite and Amorphous Graphite. Crystalline Graphite is characterized by its high degree of crystallinity, giving it a more ordered atomic structure. This type of graphite is often used in high-tech applications such as batteries, lubricants, and electrical components. Implicit Crystalline Graphite, on the other hand, has a lower degree of crystallinity and is mainly used in industrial applications such as refractories and foundry coatings. Both types play an important role in the graphite market.</p></p>
