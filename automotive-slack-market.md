<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Slack Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual Slack Adjuster</li><li>Automatic Slack Adjuster</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive slack market consists of two main types of slack adjusters: manual slack adjusters and automatic slack adjusters. Manual slack adjusters require manual adjustment by turning a bolt, while automatic slack adjusters adjust themselves based on applied pressure and wear. Manual slack adjusters are commonly found on older vehicles and require regular maintenance and adjustment, while automatic slack adjusters are becoming more popular due to their convenience and ability to maintain proper brake balance without manual intervention. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring safe and efficient brake performance in vehicles.</p></p>
