<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Buffered Oxide Etchants(BOE) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>BOE 6:1</li><li>BOE 7:1</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Buffered Oxide Etchants (BOE) are commonly used in the semiconductor industry for etching silicon dioxide. Two popular types of BOE are BOE 6:1 and BOE 7:1. The numbers refer to the ratio of HF (hydrofluoric acid) to NH4F (ammonium fluoride) in the solution. BOE 6:1 is a milder etchant with a higher concentration of NH4F, making it suitable for finer etching requirements. On the other hand, BOE 7:1 is more aggressive with a higher HF concentration, providing faster etching rates for thicker oxide layers.</p></p>
