<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automated Facade Cleaning System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact cleaning robot</li><li>Non-contact cleaning robot</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Automated Facade Cleaning System market includes two main types: Contact cleaning robots and Non-contact cleaning robots. Contact cleaning robots physically touch the surface of the building to clean, using brushes, sponges, or other tools. Non-contact cleaning robots, on the other hand, use high-pressure water or air jets to clean the facade without actually making physical contact. Both types of robots are used to efficiently and effectively clean building facades, with each having its own advantages and applications.</p></p>
