<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hand held Veterinary Refractometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Optical Refractometers</li><li>Digital Refractometers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hand held veterinary refractometers come in two main types, optical refractometers and digital refractometers. Optical refractometers use a prism to measure refractive index and are often more affordable but require manual reading of the scale. Digital refractometers use a sensor to provide a numerical reading of the refractive index, offering higher accuracy and ease of use. Both types of refractometers are commonly used in veterinary medicine for diagnosing conditions such as dehydration and monitoring urine concentration.</p></p>
