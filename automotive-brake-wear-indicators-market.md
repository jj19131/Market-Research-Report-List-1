<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Brake Wear Indicators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electrical Indicators</li><li>Audible Indicators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive brake wear indicators come in two main types: Electrical Indicators and Audible Indicators. Electrical indicators use sensors to detect brake pad wear and alert the driver through a warning light on the dashboard. Audible indicators produce a screeching noise when the brake pads are worn down, signaling that they need to be replaced. Both types of indicators serve the same purpose of notifying drivers when their brake pads are worn out and need to be changed to ensure safe driving.</p></p>
