<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fumed Alumina Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrophobic</li><li>Hydrophilic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fumed alumina is classified into two main types - hydrophobic and hydrophilic. Hydrophobic fumed alumina has a water-repellent surface, making it ideal for applications where water resistance is required. On the other hand, hydrophilic fumed alumina has a surface that attracts and interacts with water molecules, making it suitable for applications where moisture absorption is desired. Both types of fumed alumina offer unique properties that cater to different industrial needs and requirements.</p></p>
