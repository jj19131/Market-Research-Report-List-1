<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HDPE Geogrid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Biaxial Tension</li><li>Uniaxial Tension</li></ul></p>
<p><p>HDPE geogrids are commonly available in two types: biaxial tension and uniaxial tension. Biaxial tension geogrids have equal strength in both directions, making them suitable for applications where forces will be applied in multiple directions such as in pavements or retaining walls. Uniaxial tension geogrids have stronger tensile strength in one direction, making them more suitable for applications where forces will primarily be applied in one direction, like in slope stabilization or wall reinforcement. Both types offer effective solutions for enhancing soil stability and increasing the lifespan of civil engineering structures.</p></p>
