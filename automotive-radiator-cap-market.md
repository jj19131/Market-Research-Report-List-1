<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Radiator Cap Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vented Cap</li><li>Non-Vented Cap</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Automotive Radiator Cap market consists of two main types: Vented Cap and Non-Vented Cap. Vented Caps include a valve that allows for the release of excess pressure in the cooling system, preventing damage to the radiator and engine. On the other hand, Non-Vented Caps do not have this valve and simply seal off the radiator. Vented Caps are typically used in vehicles with higher performance engines or in hot climates, whereas Non-Vented Caps are more commonly found in standard vehicles with regular cooling system requirements.</p></p>
