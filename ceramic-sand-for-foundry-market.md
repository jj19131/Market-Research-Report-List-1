<p><strong>The Ceramic Sand for Foundry Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Precoated Sand</li><li>Cold Box</li><li>Self-Hardening Sand</li><li>Lost Foam Casting</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ceramic sand for foundry applications is used in various methods such as precoated sand, cold box, self-hardening sand, lost foam casting, and others. Precoated sand involves a layer of ceramic coating applied to sand grains before molding. Cold box method involves binding sand with a liquid resin catalyst. Self-hardening sand hardens on its own when exposed to air. Lost foam casting uses foam patterns that evaporate when molten metal is poured into the mold. Other methods include shell molding, investment casting, and vacuum molding.</p></p>
