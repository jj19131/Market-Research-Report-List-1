<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cell Culture Protein Surface Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-coating</li><li>Pre-coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cell culture protein surface coatings are used to promote cell adhesion, growth, and maintenance in cell culture experiments. Self-coating involves applying the protein coating directly to the cell culture surface before introducing cells. Pre-coating, on the other hand, involves purchasing pre-coated plates or dishes that already have the protein coating applied. Both types of coatings serve the same purpose of creating a suitable environment for cells to adhere and thrive in a cell culture setting.</p></p>
