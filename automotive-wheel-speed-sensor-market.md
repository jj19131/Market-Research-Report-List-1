<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Wheel Speed Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Sensor</li><li>Active Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive Wheel Speed Sensors are categorized into two main types - Passive Sensors and Active Sensors. Passive Sensors do not require an external power source and generate their own signal based on the speed of the wheel. On the other hand, Active Sensors require an external power source to operate and provide a more accurate and reliable signal. Active Sensors are commonly used in modern vehicles due to their higher performance capabilities, while Passive Sensors are more cost-effective and simpler in design.</p></p>
