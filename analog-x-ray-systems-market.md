<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Analog X-ray Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Film Based</li><li>CR Film Cassette</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Analog X-ray systems refer to traditional imaging systems that use film-based or CR (computed radiography) film cassette technology. Film-based systems involve exposing X-ray film to create images that are developed like traditional photographs. CR systems use a digital cassette to capture and transmit X-ray images to a computer for viewing and analysis. The market for film-based systems is gradually declining as CR technology becomes more popular due to its faster image processing and lower cost of maintenance.</p></p>
